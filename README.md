# BMI CALCULATOR

In this project,we are going to write a python program to calculate BMI.

Measurements:

1. Weight(kgs)
2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)
We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is Overweight,Normal,Underweight

If BMI > 25 then the person is Overweight

If BMI is between 18 and 25,the person is Normal

If BMI is < 18 then the person is Underweight
